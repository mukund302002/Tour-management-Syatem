Tour Management System Repository

Welcome to the Tour Management System repository! This repository houses a collection of C code files designed to facilitate the management of tours for both international and Indian trips. The system allows users to input their travel preferences, including the desired destination and the duration of their trip, and provides them with relevant discounts based on predefined rules. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive receipt containing all customer information details.

Key Features:
- Destination Selection: Users are prompted to choose between an international or Indian trip, enabling them to tailor their travel experience according to their preferences.
- Duration Input: Customers can specify the number of days they plan to spend on their tour, allowing for accurate calculations of discounts and total costs.
- Discount Calculation: The system incorporates a set of rules to calculate applicable discounts based on the chosen destination and duration of the trip. This ensures that customers receive the most suitable and cost-effective options.
- Receipt Generation: After gathering all the necessary information, the system generates a detailed receipt that includes customer information, trip details, calculated discounts, and the final cost.

We believe that this Tour Management System repository will be a valuable resource for those interested in implementing an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing tour operations. Whether you are a developer looking for inspiration or a travel agency seeking to enhance your booking process, this repository provides a solid foundation to build upon.

Feel free to explore the repository, examine the code files, and make any necessary modifications to adapt the system to your specific requirements. We welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature requests from the open-source community to continuously improve this project.

Thank you for your interest in the Tour Management System repository, and we hope it proves to be a useful tool in simplifying the complexities of tour management and enhancing the overall customer experience.
